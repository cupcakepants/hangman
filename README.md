# hangman
6.037 project
Run main.cpp to play hangman. There are three options:
you can play with the current list of words and chose
a difficulty, you can add a word to the list of words,
or you and a friend can play with a word one of you 
inputs. 

Note: we use relative paths. For some compilers, one 
may have to edit the the configurations.
