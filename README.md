# hangman

6.037 project

Run main.cpp to play hangman. 

There are three options: 
1) Chose one of three difficulties (easy, medium, hard) and play hangman with a random word of that difficulty. 
2) Add a word to the list of words that a player can play with. 
3) Play with a word you put in (good for when you are playing with friends)
